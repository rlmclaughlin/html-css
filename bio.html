                <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">A Little About Myself...</h2>
                <br/>
                <p>My name is Ryan McLaughlin and I'm a musician-turned-web-developer from Dallas, Texas.</p>          
                <br/>
                <p>A large part of my life has been dedicated to capturing sudden sparks of creativity and 
                   transforming these mental constructs into tangible products. Sometimes, this may consist 
                   of turning a song idea into a recorded piece of media. Other times, this may take the form 
                   of an innovative website concept that must be coded into fruition. It's these simple acts of 
                   creativity that drive my inner ambition and keep my will in a perpetual quest to penetrate
                   new thresholds of originality.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>One may wonder how I went from being a musician to a developer? While there were many preceding 
                   steps, things really found their stride in June of 2018. This was the month that I began class at 
                   Lambda School and embarked my web development journey. This would mark the pivotal moment in my life
                   when everything when would change and my true path would be defined.</p>

                    <h2>Tell Me More...</h2>                  
                    <p>Lambda is a 9+ month computer science and software engineering program that provides an immersive 
                       hands-on curriculum with a focus on computer science, and fullstack web development. I entered the 
                       program with a minimal amount of coding knowledge but evolved into a full stack developer by the end 
                       of the cirriculum. I still find myself absolutely stunned when I reflect on all of the things i've
                       learned and utilized in a short amount of time. I had the pleasure of working on an array of exciting 
                       projects with a plethora of talented teams. I even had the opportunity to fulfill roles in leadership 
                       positions, which have facilitated a wealth of personal growth. 
                       <br/>
                       <br/>
                       At this point in my life, I've created sites pertaining to games, news, stocks, and I'm even working on 
                       an ecommerce site. Coding is a pretty amazing thing! It allows you to take ideas and turn them into a useful product.
                       It also provides you with a set of tools for solving problems that's extremely useful beyond the keyboard.</p>
