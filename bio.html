            <br/>
            <p>My name is Ryan McLaughlin and I'm a musician-turned-web-developer from Dallas, Texas.</p>          
            <br/>
            <p>A large part of my life has been dedicated to capturing sudden sparks of creativity and 
               transforming these mental constructs into tangible products. Sometimes, this may consist 
               of turning a song idea into a recorded piece of media. Other times, this may take the form 
               of an innovative website concept that must be coded into fruition. It's these simple acts of 
               creativity that drive my inner ambition and keep my will in a perpetual quest to penetrate
               new thresholds of originality.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>One may wonder how I went from being a musician to a developer? While there were many preceding 
               steps, things really found their stride in June of 2018. This was the month that I began class at 
               Lambda School and embarked my web development journey.</p>
            <br/>

            <p>Lambda is a 9+ month computer science and software engineering program that provides an immersive 
               hands-on curriculum with a focus on computer science, and fullstack web development. I entered the 
               program with a minimal amount of coding knowledge but evolved into a full stack developer by the end 
               of the cirriculum. I still find myself absolutely stunned when I reflect on all of the things i've
               learned and utilized in a short amount of time. I had the pleasure of working on an array of exciting 
               projects with a plethora of talented teams. I even had the opportunity to fulfill roles in leadership 
               positions, which have facilitated a wealth of personal growth. I'll forever be grateful for this 
               experience, as it has turned my life around and benifited me in every possible way.</p>
            <br/>

            <p>Best regards,</p>
